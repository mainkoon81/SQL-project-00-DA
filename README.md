__Data:__ Northwind-SQLite3 Data set

This is a version of the Microsoft Access 2000 Northwind sample database, re-engineered for SQLite3. It was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial schema for managing small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees. All the TABLES and VIEWS from the MSSQL-2000 version have been converted to Sqlite3 and included here. Also included are two versions prepopulated with data - a small verison and a large version. Should you decide to, you can use the included python script to pump the database full of more data.
